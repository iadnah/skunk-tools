jack
=========
jack is a PHP script which provides rudimentary functions similar to netcat.

Jack can:
* Scan for open TCP ports (with optional banner grabbing)
** Non-ASCII banners are displayed as hex
* Create a bindshell on a specified port
* Create a TCP connect-back shell
* Perform basic wordlist-based DNS subdomain bruteforcing
